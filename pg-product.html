                    It has unwound many business units including Sony Chemicals and Vaio PC but still runs diverse businesses.

                    Sony released the world's first portable music player, the Walkman, in 1979, bundled with the MDL-3L2 headphones. 
                    This line fostered a fundamental change in music listening habits by allowing people to carry music with them and 
                    listen to music through lightweight headphones. Originally used to refer portable audio cassette players, the Walkman
                    brand has been widely adopted by the company to encompass its portable digital audio and video players as well as a 
                    line of former Sony Ericsson mobile phones. In the case of optical disc players, the Discman brand was used until 
                    the late 1990s. In 1999 Sony's first portable digital audio players were introduced; one was a player using Memory 
                    Stick flash storage created by the Walkman division, and the other was a smaller pen-sized player with embedded flash
                    storage created by the Vaio division; both accompanied with Sony's OpenMG copyright protection technology and PC 
                    software for music transfer.

                    Sony produced the TV8-301, the world's first all-transistor television, in 1959.[80] In 1968, the company introduced 
                    the Trinitron brand name for its lines of aperture grille cathode ray tube televisions and afterwards computer 
                    monitors. Sony discontinued its series of Trinitron computer monitors in 2005. The company discontinued the last 
                    Trinitron-based television set in the US in early 2007.

                    Sony used the LCD WEGA name for its LCD TVs until summer 2005. The company then introduced the BRAVIA name. BRAVIA 
                    is an in-house brand owned by Sony which produces high-definition LCD televisions, projection TVs and front projectors, home cinemas and the BRAVIA home theatre range. All Sony 
                    high-definition flat-panel LCD televisions in North America have carried the logo for BRAVIA since 2005. In 2006, 
                    Sony lost its decades-long No.1 market share in the global television market. In November 2007, the Sony XEL-1, the 
                    first OLED television, was released and manufactured for two years. Later in 2013, Sony demonstrated the first 4K OLED 
                    television.

                    From 2011, Sony started restructuring of its loss-making television business, mainly by down-sizing business units 
                    and outsourcing the manufacturing of display panels to the companies like Sharp Corporation, LG Display, and Samsung 
                    Electronics. Sony's small-sized LCD business subsidiary and medium-to-large-sized OLED display business unit were 
                    spun off and became part of Japan Display and JOLED, respectively.

                    Sony offers a wide range of digital cameras. Its point-and-shoot models adopt the Cyber-shot name, while digital \
                    single-lens reflex models are branded using Alpha. It also produces action cameras and camcorders, with the company's

                    Sony demonstrated a prototype of the Sony Mavica in 1981 and released it for the consumer market in 1988. The first 
                    Cyber-shot was introduced in 1996. Sony entered the market for digital single-lens reflex cameras in 2006 when it 
                    acquired the camera business of Konica Minolta. Sony rebranded the company's line of cameras as its Alpha line. Sony 
                    is the world's third largest manufacturer of the cameras, behind Canon and Nikon respectively.

                    In 2010, Sony introduced their first mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras, which were the NEX-3 and the NEX-5. 
                    They also started a new lens mount system, which was the E-mount. There were quite a few NEX models out there, when 
                    Sony decided to melt the NEX series into the Alpha series. The first Alpha MILC was the α3000, which was introduced 
                    in August 2013. It was followed by the Full-Frame α7 and α7R in October, then the successors of the NEX-5, the NEX-6 
                    and NEX-7, the α5000 and the α6000 in 2014. The α6000 became the most popular MILC ever and Sony became the largest 
                    MILC manufacturer. Sony didn't announce a new DSLR since the November 2015, which was the α68.

                    2006, resulting in the largest computer-related recall to that point in history.

                    Since 2012, Sony's Android products have been marketed under the Xperia brand used for its smartphones. On 4 February 
                    2014, Sony announced that it would sell its VAIO PC business due to poor sales and Japanese company Japan Industrial

                    entered into a joint venture with Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson, forming Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications.
                    The company distinguished itself with multimedia-capable mobile phones, which included features such as cameras. 
                    These were unusual at the time. Despite their innovations, Sony Ericsson faced intense competition from Apple's iPhone, 
                    which was released in 2007. From 2008 to 2010, amid a global recession, Sony Ericsson slashed its workforce by several thousand.

                    become the most successful of all time, selling over 150 million units as of 2011. Sony released the PlayStation 3, a 
                    high-definition console, in 2006. It was the first console to use the Blu-ray format, and was considerably more 
                    expensive than the competitors Xbox 360 and Wii due to the Cell processor.

                    The PlayStation 3 sold generally more poorly than its competitors in the early years of its release but managed to 
                    overtake the Xbox 360 in global sales later on. It later introduced the PlayStation Move, an accessory that allows 
                    players to control video games using motion gestures.

                    Sony extended the brand to the portable games market in 2004 with the PlayStation Portable (PSP). The console has sold 
                    reasonably, but has taken a second place to a rival handheld, the Nintendo DS. Sony developed the Universal Media 
                    Disc (UMD) optical disc medium for use on the PlayStation Portable. Sony released a disc-less version of its PlayStation 
                    Portable, the PSP Go, in 2009. The company went on to release its second portable video game system, PlayStation Vita, 
                    in 2011 and 2012. Sony launched its fourth console, the PlayStation 4, on 15 November 2013, which as of 31 December 
                    2017 has sold 73.6 million units globally.

                    The IT giants such as Google (Google driverless car/Waymo) and Apple (iCar/Project Titan) have been working on 
                    electric vehicles and self driving cars, competing with Tesla; Sony was considered to be following suit with an 
                    $842,000 investment in ZMP INC. In January 2020, Sony unveiled a concept electric car at the Consumer Electronics Show, 
                    named Vision-S, designed in collaboration with components manufacturer Magna International. At the occasion, Sony also 
                    stated its goal of developing technology for the automotive sector, especially concerning autonomous driving, sensors, and 
                    in-car entertainment.
