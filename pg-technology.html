                            Sony has historically been notable for creating its own in-house standards for new recording and storage 
                            technologies, instead of adopting those of other manufacturers and standards bodies. Sony 
                            (either alone or with partners) has introduced several of the most popular recording formats, including 
                            the 3.5-inch floppy disk, Compact Disc and Blu-ray Disc.

                            Sony introduced U-matic, the world's first videocassette format, in 1971, but the standard was unpopular 
                            for domestic use due to the high price. The company subsequently launched the Betamax format in 1975. 
                            Sony was involved in the videotape format war of the early 1980s, when they were marketing the Betamax system
                            for video cassette recorders against the VHS format developed by JVC. In the end, VHS gained critical 
                            mass in the marketbase and became the worldwide standard for consumer VCRs.

                            Betamax is, for all practical purposes, an obsolete format. Sony's professional-oriented component video format 
                            called Betacam, which was derived from Betamax, was used until 2016 when Sony announced it was stopping production of 
                            all remaining 1/2-inch video tape recorders and players, including the Digital Betacam format.

                            In 1985, Sony launched their Handycam products and the Video8 format. Video8 and the follow-on hi-band Hi8 format 
                            became popular in the consumer camcorder market. In 1987 Sony launched the 4 mm DAT or Digital Audio Tape as a new 
                            digital audio tape standard.

                            Sony held a patent for its proprietary Trinitron until 1996a and follow-on introduced the Triluminos Display, the company's 
                            proprietary color reproduction enhancing technology, in 2004, featured in the world's first LED-backlit LCD televisions. It 
                            was widely used in other Sony's products as well, including computer monitors, laptops, and smartphones. In 2013, Sony released 
                            a new line of televisions with an improved version of the technology, which incorporated quantum dots in the backlight system. 
                            It was the first commercial use of quantum dots

                            Sony used the Compact Cassette format in many of its tape recorders and players, including the Walkman, the world's first portable 
                            music player. Sony introduced the MiniDisc format in 1992 as an alternative to Philips DCC or Digital Compact Cassette and as a 
                            successor to the Compact Cassette. Since the introduction of MiniDisc, Sony has attempted to promote its own audio compression 
                            technologies under the ATRAC brand, against the more widely used MP3. Until late 2004, Sony's Network Walkman line of digital portable
                            music players did not support the MP3 standard natively.

                        </br>
                            In 2004, Sony built upon the MiniDisc format by releasing Hi-MD. Hi-MD allows the playback and recording of audio on newly introduced 1 
                            GB Hi-MD discs in addition to playback and recording on regular MiniDiscs. In addition to saving audio on the discs, Hi-MD allows the 
                            storage of computer files such as documents, videos and photos.

                            In 1993, Sony challenged the industry standard Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound format with a newer and more advanced proprietary 
                            motion picture digital audio format called SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound). This format employed eight channels (7.1) of audio 
                            opposed to just six used in Dolby Digital 5.1 at the time. Ultimately, SDDS has been vastly overshadowed by the preferred DTS 
                            (Digital Theatre System) and Dolby Digital standards in the motion picture industry. SDDS was solely developed for use in the theatre
                            circuit; Sony never intended to develop a home theatre version of SDDS.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                            Sony and Philips jointly developed the Sony-Philips digital interface format (S/PDIF) and the high-fidelity audio system SACD. The latter 
                            became entrenched in a format war with DVD-Audio. Still, neither gained a major foothold with the general public. CDs had been preferred 
                            by consumers because of the ubiquitous presence of CD drives in consumer devices until the early 2000s when the iPod and streaming 
                            services became available

                            Sony demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in 1977 and soon joined hands with Philips, another major contender for the storage technology, 
                            to establish a worldwide standard. In 1983, the two company jointly announced the Compact Disc (CD). In 1984, Sony launched the Discman series,
                            an expansion of the Walkman brand to portable CD players. Sony began to improve performance and capacity of the novel format. It launched write-once
                            optical discs (WO) and magneto-optical discs which were around 125MB size for the specific use of archival data storage, in 1986 and 1988 respectively.

                            In the early 1990s, two high-density optical storage standards were being developed: one was the MultiMedia Compact Disc (MMCD), backed by Philips 
                            and Sony, and the other was the Super Density Disc (SD), supported by Toshiba and many others. Philips and Sony abandoned their MMCD format and agreed 
                            upon Toshiba's SD format with only one modification. The unified disc format was called DVD and was introduced in 1997.

                            Sony was one of the leading developers of the Blu-ray optical disc format, the newest standard for disc-based content delivery. The first Blu-ray players 
                            became commercially available in 2006. The format emerged as the standard for HD media over the competing format, Toshiba's HD DVD, after a two-year-long 
                            high-definition optical disc format war.

                            In 1983, Sony introduced 90 mm micro diskettes (better known as 3.5-inch (89 mm) floppy disks), which it had developed at a time when
                            there were 4" floppy disks, and many variations from different companies, to replace the then on-going 5.25" floppy disks. Sony had 
                            great success and the format became dominant. 3.5" floppy disks gradually became obsolete as they were replaced by current media formats. 
                            Sony held more than a 70 percent share of the market when it decided to pull the plug on the format in 2010.

                            In 1998, Sony launched the Memory Stick format, the flash memory cards for use in Sony lines of digital cameras and portable music 
                            players. It has seen little support outside of Sony's own products, with Secure Digital cards (SD) commanding considerably greater 
                            popularity. Sony has made updates to the Memory Stick format with Memory Stick Duo and Memory Stick Micro.

                            Sony introduced FeliCa, a contactless IC card technology primarily used in contactless payment, as a result of the company's joint 
                            development and commercialization of Near-Field Communication (NFC) with Philips. The standard is largely offered in two forms, either
                            chips embedded in smartphones or plastic cards with chips embedded in them. Sony plans to implement this technology in train systems 
                            across Asia.
